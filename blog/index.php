        <h5 class="card-title">FAQs #1:“How come when I’m high, I want to be sober, but when I’m sober, I want to be high?”</h5>
        <p class="card-text">When you are sober and you want to get high, that is simply your brain craving the drug. Your brain will make you believe anything to get it’s dopamine fix. It might tell you that getting high would be fun, that it’ll help you forget about your problems, or that it’ll be like old times. The truth is, when you are experiencing a craving, your brain will tell you whatever you need to hear at that particular moment to convince you to give in.</p>
        <p class="card-text">When you are high, however, you want to be sober. This is because you are experiencing, first-hand, the reality of getting high— anxiety, paranoia, and lethargy — and so it is obvious you want to quit.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The key is to remind yourself that when you want to get high, you do not actually want to get high, but your brain is simply craving its fix. The genuine you, separate from your brain, does NOT want to get high. You must recognise that your brain is a separate entity to your actual self. Just because your brain wants to get high, that doesn’t mean you want to get high.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">FAQs #2: “Do I really need to quit? Can’t I just moderate my use?”</h5>
        <p class="card-text">How many times have you tried to moderate your use? How many times have you said that this time will be the time you will learn to moderate?</p>
        <p class="card-text">After you begin to question your relationship with cannabis, but before you are truly ready to leave it behind, there is often a period of denial where you try to moderate your use. Unwilling to completely give it up (because hey, remember the good times?), we tell ourselves that if we could just smoke in the evenings, or at the weekend, or once a month, we don’t need to quit at all.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Like a toxic relationship you just cannot bring yourself to leave, we are drawn in by promises that things will change, or that after all the negatives, there are still some positives. The thing is, a few minor positives do not outweigh countless major negatives.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The key is to remind yourself that when you want to get high, you do not actually want to get high, but your brain is simply craving its fix. The genuine you, separate from your brain, does NOT want to get high. You must recognise that your brain is a separate entity to your actual self. Just because your brain wants to get high, that doesn’t mean you want to get high.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Here’s the thing: if we could moderate our use, we wouldn’t have a problem in the first place. The dream of moderation ignores the reality that we are addicted. Addiction is something to be taken seriously — just as we would not expect an alcoholic to moderate their drinking, for those of us addicted to cannabis, abstinence in the only way out.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Rejecting the need to quit and fantasising about using weed responsibly is dangerous. It ignores the complex causes behind your addiction and implies that if you could only approach weed with the right attitude, you could moderate. This delusional thinking keeps us stuck in a never-ending cycle of addiction. For me, despite repeated attempts to moderate my use (I tried to use weed responsibly for three years), it never worked out.</p>
        <p class="card-text">The reason we fall prey to the idea of moderation is because, at first, we find it difficult to imagine life without our beloved herb. It’s normal to feel scared about what lies ahead, but don’t let this fear convince you that you can keep on smoking if you could only just figure out how to moderate. There is nothing to figure out — you have an addiction.</p>
        <p class="card-text">Next time you tell yourself you should try moderating your use, remind yourself of what happened the last time (or ten times) you tried to moderate your use.</p>
